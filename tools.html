     <h1>I use many tools in my work. Here are a few of my favourites</h1>

     <br />
     <h1>Power tools / machines</h1>
     <p>Startrite 351 bandsaw - my workhorse for cutting wood and my prized possession. Can cut straight lines, curves and really thick material</p>
     <p>Milwaukee power tools. Apologies to the DeWalt and Makita fans but when you watch a 12 tonne digger run over a rotary tool and leave it unscathed, you pick the winning team</p>
     <p>Bester stick welder. It built me a workshop. I'm quite fond of the ESAB MIG welder at my university's workshop though. A MIG welder is on my wishlist</p>
     <p>Makita corded angle grinder. Cheap and cheerful. Not too heavy and doesn't overheat. Small and manageable with a rubber cable</p>

     <br />
     <h1>P.P.E</h1>
     <p>3M AdFlo G5-01 welding helmet with air filter. I want to keep my lungs healthy. This is one of the most used bits of kit I have</p>
     <p>3M half face respirator with replaceable filter cartridges for all those other respiratory protection requirements. Every maker should have one of these at least</p>
     <p>Blundstone steel toe safety boots. Great for messy jobs and working with large, heavy pieces. Stops your toes getting mangled. And no laces which makes them easy to put on and great for welders</p>
     <p>Gloves. Nitrile gloves, Welding gauntlets and general work gloves. Get well fitting ones and you'll always wear them</p>

     <br />
     <h1>Hand tools</h1>
     <p>Gyokucho Japanese style ryoba saw. Do you want a really really good saw? This is a really really good saw</p>
     <p>Selection of hammers. It's amazing how many problems can be solved with a big hammer. Just ask Thor</p>
     <p>Steel rule. Use it to mark out lines, as a cutting guide or just wave it around like you're Inigo Montoya</p>
     <p>Mole grips. Adjust with the thumb screw then close handle till it locks. Clamps things really firmly. It's my go to for removing irritating nuts and bolts</p>
     <p>Utility knife. Make sure to replace the blades regularly and you'll be able to cut through all sorts. And get a retractable one if you value your longevity</p>
     <p>Spare blades for utility knife. Get a 100 pack and watch it slowly diminish as you cut your way through many obstacles</p>
     <p>Clamps. There are never enough clamps. Have lots. Cheap spring clamps from the Aldi middle aisle, Irwin & Record brand clamps and F-clamps. I'm quite keen on F-clamps</p>

     <br />
     <h1>Other stuff</h1>
     <p>Presto white out markers and Posca paint pens. Great for marking labels on virtually any material</p>
     <p>Duck brand masking tape. Just the right amount of stick without ripping off paint when you remove it although there are probably cheaper varieties</p>
     <p>Duck tape. It holds the universe together. Do yourself a favour and get some. It comes in handy</p>
     <p>Perforated metal strip. If duck tape ever had a superior. This would be it. Usually used to hang pipes from beams and floor joists. Can also be used to strap stuff to other stuff</p>
     <p>Uni-ball Eye Rollerball pens. I hate the patchy coverage of biros and fineliners are too much for writing with. These leave butter smooth marks</p>
     <p>Pentel 0.9mm P209 mechanical pencil. My go to pencil and note taker. Get soft leads and you'll have both sharp and soft lines at your disposal without needing a sharpener</p>
     <p>Moleskine Cahier notebooks. These come in multipacks and are the right size to fit in a pocket or throw in your bag</p>
     <p>Swarfega. Gritty green soap that will scrub off any sort of oil and grime and leave your hands like new</p>
     <p>WD-40. It was originally designed as a solvent for keeping the skins of Atlas missiles free of rust. Now it's the smelly spray of choice for DIYers everywhere</p>
     <p>Some sort of cutting oil. Will help your drill bits last much longer without dulling if you drill steel and aluminium</p>
     <p>O'Keeffe's Working Hands cream. For those less enamoured by leathery worker hands. I've been informed it even clears up eczema</p>
